# TAFN
Temporal Attention Fusion Network for EEG-fNIRS classification

This study propose a novel temporal attention fusion network (TAFN) with a custom loss function. The TAFN model incorporates attention mechanisms to its long short-term memory and temporal convolutional layers to accurately capture spatial and temporal dependencies in the EEGâ€“fNIRS data. The custom loss function combines class weights and asymmetric loss terms to ensure the precise classification of cognitive and motor intentions, along with addressing class imbalance issues.
